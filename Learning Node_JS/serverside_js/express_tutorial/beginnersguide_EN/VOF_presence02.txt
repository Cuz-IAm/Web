0 4.15 Because from my perspective at the time and just what I knew of him,
4.77 6.99 this was a result of how isolated he was.
7.42 13.18 He was in his own little bubble, sitting at his computer all day, not really showing these games to anyone,
13.54 15.76 not releasing them onto the internet,
16.23 21.06 and so he didn't have anyone outside of himself to connect with.
21.52 24.29 He had no outlet to ground himself on.
