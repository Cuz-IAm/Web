8.64 16.66 This was actually the first game of his that I ever played, this was shortly after I met him at a weekend game jam in Sacramento where I grew up.
17.06 22.59 I saw him working on this very level, and it was just so different from anything that anyone else was doing
22.77 26.32 so right away I was like, I have to be friends with this person.
27.2 31.84  In retrospect I think I was probably a bit too pushy trying to get his attention.
32.7 34.31 I was overenthusiastic.
34.64 37.89 But he was very gracious about it and very patient with me.
38.85 40.95 And I cooled off eventually.
