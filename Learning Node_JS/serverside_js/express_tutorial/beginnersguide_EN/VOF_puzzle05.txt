0 3.42 How about that, there was more to it than we had any way of knowing.
4.07 9.68 I actually find it funny that this game comes after the stairs game, since they essentially convey the opposite idea.
10.09 14.92 So in the stairs game a dull exterior concealed a rich interior,
14.92 19.76 and then in this level a dull interior hides a fantastic outer world.
20.51 25.94 Either way I think the point is the same, is that most of the time you don't get to know what you're missing,
26.17 29.88 or even that you're missing anything, that's not your role as a player.
30.79 35.05 So if your role here is not to understand, then what is it?
