5.52 10.84 Like the invisible maze, it's frustrating to me because it's the opposite of everything else Coda has made,

18.14 21.46 If I could have reached him during this time then maybe I could have asked him,
21.76 25.16 but I couldn't, I still don't really understand why this is here.
26.52 29.23 I'll put the code on the ground here for you so that we can move on.
