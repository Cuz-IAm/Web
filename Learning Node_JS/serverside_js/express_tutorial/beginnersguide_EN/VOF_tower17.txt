-0.01 4.01 That's why I'm releasing this collection of your work,
4.23 8.89 is because I haven't been able to find any other way to reach you. I've tried everything.
9.51 14.5 And...so a part of me has hope, that if I put this compilation out into the world,
14.57 19.2 and if I put my name on it, that maybe enough people will play it so that it will find its way to you,
19.59 22.86 so that I can tell you that...I'm sorry.
23.47 24.98 I know I screwed up.
25.54 30.94 If I apologize to you truly and deeply, will you start making games again?
31.76 38.23 Please, I need to feel OK with myself again, and I always felt OK as long as I had your work to see myself in.
38.89 41.39 I mean, is something wrong with me?
42.32 47.67 Because I know I'm doing an awful thing, and I'm doing it again right now, I'm showing people your work,
47.81 54.71 but I can't stop myself from doing it, that's how badly I need to feel something again, like I'm an addict.
55.09 56.72 There has to be something wrong with me!
57.08 59.92 Can I apologize? What if I tell you I was wrong, will that work, will that fix it?
59.95 62.74 I- I don't know! I don't don't think it will, but there's nothing else that I can do!
62.81 67.19 Just tell me what you want! I'm.. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
67.42 73.66 Please start making games again, please help me, please give me some of whatever it is that makes you complete,
73.77 81.12 I want whatever that wholeness is that you summoned out of nothing and put into your work, you were complete in some way that I never was.
81.36 86.09 I want - I want to know how to be a good person, I want to know how not to hate myself. Please!
87.05 92.15 I'm fading. And all I want is to know that I'm going to be okay.
