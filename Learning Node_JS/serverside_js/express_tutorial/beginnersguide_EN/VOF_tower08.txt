0 4.71 I remember, it's June of 2011, I'm playing this for the very first time,
5.13 7.36 and as I'm playing I'm thinking to myself:
8.55 10.78 I don't know this person.
11.28 13.88 I have no idea who this person is.
14.92 17.69 It wasn't the guy I knew, it wasn't my friend.
18.52 23.88 I had come to so many conclusions from looking at all of his work up until this point, and then suddenly none of them...
