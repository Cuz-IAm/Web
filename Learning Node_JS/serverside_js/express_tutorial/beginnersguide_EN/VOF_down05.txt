0 5.28 This is something he and I used to argue about a lot, you know, whether a game ought to actually be playable,
5.44 7.75 whether it means anything if no one can get through it,
8.24 14.43 and I would always defend that, you know, all this work goes into the game, why not make it playable and accessible?
14.57 19.99 And so we just got into heated arguments over it, and there was one time that after one of these conversations
20.07 26.26 he went home and a day or two later he sent me a zip file entitled “Playable Games,”
26.36 34.84 that was full of hundreds of individual games, each of which was just an empty box that you walked around in and nothing else.
35.47 40.45 Believe me, I played every single one of those just to find out if there was a gag hidden somewhere.
41.52 42.78 There wasn't.
