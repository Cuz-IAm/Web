0 1.13 It's a lamppost.
1.88 6.88 Okay, I can't tell you quite why but for some reason Coda fixates on this lamppost,
7.29 11.05 it's going to appear at the end of every single one of his games from here on out.
12.14 21.02 I'll tell you what I think, I think up to this point he's been making really strange and abstract games with no clear purpose,
21.27 24.37 and maybe you can only float around in that headspace for so long.
24.89 31.22 Because now he wants something to hold onto. He wants a reference point, he wants the work to be leading to something.
31.65 36.79 He wants a destination! Which is what this lamppost is, it's a destination.
37.72 46.07 We're gonna see it in the work as well, his games are going to become a lot more cohesive, a lot more fully developed, with more of a clear idea behind them.
46.37 50.97 And as we go, that idea will get clearer and clearer and clearer.
